## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

I learned how to google a problem and how i can work with loops to target and change styles on multiple elements within a js file.

see the code snippet below for the loop i used.


```
```js
 for(let i = 0; i< elem.length; i++){
        elem[i].classList.remove("fa-circle")
    }

```




### Continued development

I will use my time to focuss on loops and different ways i can use them and different loops i can use.
